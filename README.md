## What are we working on?

Our focus is to open a door for Trans and Gender Nonconforming BIPOC communities to access better resources. In order to bring that upfront, I am looking to talk with people with expertise in providing mental health services for trans folks of color, as I am learning how they have been impacted by Covid-19. Iâ€™d love to learn from you.
